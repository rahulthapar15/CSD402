        "answer": "Sure, I mean if either of them actually had a monopoly on a single OS platform. Legally, as long as your board of directors keeps you as CEO, you are free to run the company, you don’t need any votes.But if you want to ensure you remain CEO, the simplest way to do that is to own more than50% of the voting stock of the company. Then you can appoint all the directors and pick people who will never challenge your position as CEO."

        "question": "I have an idea for a tech startup with no tech background. What should I do?",
        "answer": "If you are intent on starting a service, you need to quickly build your MVP and get user feedback before you invest more time/energy/resources into the effort. The search for a technical co-founder might take some time and you need to be very careful before you decide to partner with someone. A CTO will need to have the skills to lead the evolution of your company’s technology stack if the business becomes successful."
